## What is Bootstrap?


Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for developing responsive websites. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for items like forms, buttons, tables, modals, etc. as well as optional Javascript plugins.


#### Advantages of using Bootstrap:

   - Easy to use
   - Responsive features
   - "Mobile-first" approach
   - Compatibile with all modern browsers
      
      
#### How to include Bootstrap into your webpage

   - Download Bootstrap from www.getbootstrap.com
   - Include Bootstrap CDN(Content Delivery Network) in the header section of HTML file:
   
            <!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">
            
            
            <!-- jQuery library -->
            <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
            
            
            <!-- Latest compiled JavaScript -->
            <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
  
  - Since Bootstrap is "mobile-first", you also need to include the following line of code into the header section...
  
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
          
       This will scale the webpage to fit the size of the screen of the device viweing it.
